11:40 added the base scaffolding, however i am having trouble updating the database using the Update-Database command

Error I have been recieving
A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server. The server was not found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance name is correct and that SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections. (provider: SQL Network Interfaces, error: 26 - Error Locating Server/Instance Specified)

1:01 Realized I was typing in the Registered Database as ClockContext instead of ClocksContext
